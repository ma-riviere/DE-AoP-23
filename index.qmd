  This website showcases the data and analyses of our paper:  

  [*"Apnea of Prematurity induces short and long-term development-related transcriptional changes in the murine cerebellum"*]{#paper-title}

  The goal is to allow interested parties to explore our data and see the output of our analyses without running the code themselves.

  ::: {.callout-tip appearance="simple"}
  If you wish to access the code of the analyses themselves, head to [the main branch of our repository](https://github.com/ma-riviere/DE-AoP-23).

  You can find more information on the overarching project that lead to this paper on the first author's [website](https://agalic-rd.com/content/projects/DE-AoP/).
