At birth,\n    the human cerebellar cortex is still immature, making it vulnerable\n    to perinatal events. Moreover, a correlation between cerebellar\n    functions and the deficits observed in children having suffered from\n    AOP has been demonstrated. Yet, the cerebellar alterations\n    underpinning this link remain poorly understood. To shed light on\n    the involvement of the cerebellum in perinatal hypoxia-related\n    sequelae, we developed a mouse model of AOP. In previous works, we\n    found that IH induces oxidative stress in the developing cerebellum\n    as shown by the overexpression of genes involved in reactive oxygen\n    species production, and the under-expression of genes encoding\n    antioxidant enzymes. These alterations suggest a failure of the\n    defense system against oxidative stress and could be responsible for\n    neuronal death in the cerebellum. Based on these results, we\n    performed a transcriptomic study of the genes involved in the\n    processes that occur during cerebellar development. We analyzed the\n    expression of these genes at various developmental stages and in\n    different cell types, by real time PCR. This enabled us to pinpoint\n    a timeframe of vulnerability at P8, which represents the age with\n    the highest number of downregulated genes in the cerebellum.\n    Moreover, we identified several molecular pathways that are impacted\n    by our IH protocol, such as proliferation, migration, and\n    differentiation. This suggests that IH can modify the development of\n    various cells, and then contribute to the histological and\n    behavioral deficits already observed in this model. Overall, our\n    data indicate that the cerebellum is highly sensitive to IH, and\n    provide elements to better understand the pathophysiology of AOP by\n    deciphering its cellular and molecular causal mechanisms. In the\n    long term, the present results could lead to the identification of\n    novel therapeutic targets to improve the clinical management of this\n    highly prevalent pathology.}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\nRodriguez-Duboc, A., Basille-Duguay, M., Debonne, A., Rivière, M.-A.,\nVaudry, D., & Burel, D.
